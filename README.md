# WHAT IS IT .

**THE PROBLEM:** Without a doubt, the best way to learn a language is by immersion. Using the language as often as possible and listening to the language daily whether through music, television, or good ol' conversation with a native speaker. Learning grammar and drilling vocabulary is certainly helpful and often necessary, but there's nothing like immersion to improve your fluency but it's not always possible to use a foreign language every day in real life. This is where Rivetr can help. 

**WHAT RIVETR DOES FOR YOU:** It's like twitter -- but for language learners alike. It doesn't teach you a language in itself, but it aids your learning by normalizing your usage of the language, by bringing it into your daily life. We tweet things in our native language spontaneously whenever we think of something funny, cool, whatever -- so why not do that in a foreign language directly to a community also trying to learn the same language, or even better, is a native speaker? When you post things, the community can proofread and make corrections, or if your grammar and spelling is awesome? Well, it's just like twitter, so they can react to your post however they want (reply, favorite). And don't you feel all left out now, you can do all of that too. Once you join rivetr, you're a part of the community as well.
